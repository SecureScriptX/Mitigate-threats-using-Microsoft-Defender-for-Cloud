**Microsoft Defender for DNS** adds an extra layer of protection to your cloud resources by:

- Continuously monitoring all DNS queries from your Azure resources
- Running advanced security analytics to alert you about suspicious activity

#### Benefits of Microsoft Defender for DNS

Defender for DNS protects against a variety of security issues, including:

- **Data exfiltration** via DNS tunneling from your Azure resources
- **Malware communication** with command and control (C&C) servers
- Communication with **malicious domains** used for phishing or crypto mining
- **DNS attacks** involving communication with malicious DNS resolvers
