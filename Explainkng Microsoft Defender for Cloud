### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Features

Microsoft Defender for Cloud covers two broad pillars of cloud security:

#### 1. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

In Defender for Cloud, posture management features provide:

- **Visibility** - Helps you understand your current security situation.
- **Hardening guidance** - Helps you efficiently and effectively improve your security posture.

The central feature in Defender for Cloud for achieving these goals is the **secure score**. Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your resources, subscriptions, and organization for security issues. It aggregates all findings into a single score, allowing you to quickly understand your security status: the higher the score, the lower the risk.

#### 2. Cloud Workload Protection (CWP)

Defender for Cloud also provides security alerts powered by **Microsoft Threat Intelligence**, along with a range of advanced, intelligent protections for your workloads. These protections are provided through Microsoft Defender's enhanced security features, tailored to the specific types of resources in your subscriptions. 

For example, you can enable **Microsoft Defender for Storage** to receive alerts about suspicious activities related to your Azure Storage accounts.
