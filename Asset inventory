## Overview

Defender for Cloud periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources to identify potential security vulnerabilities. It then provides recommendations for remediating those vulnerabilities. When any resource has outstanding recommendations, they'll appear in the inventory.

### Key Questions Addressed

- Which of my subscriptions with Microsoft Defender for Cloud enabled have outstanding recommendations?
- Which of my machines with the tag 'Production' are missing the Log Analytics agent?
- How many of my machines tagged with a specific tag have outstanding recommendations?
- How many resources in a specific resource group have security findings from a vulnerability assessment service?

The asset management possibilities for this tool are substantial and continue to grow.

## Key Features of Asset Inventory

- **Total resources:** The total number of resources connected to Defender for Cloud.
- **Unhealthy resources:** Resources with active security recommendations.
- **Unmonitored resources:** Resources with agent monitoring issues.

### Asset Management Options
- **Assign tags** to filtered resources by selecting the checkboxes next to the relevant resources.

- **Automate workloads** with Azure Logic Apps using the Trigger Logic App button.

## How Asset Inventory Works

Asset inventory leverages Azure Resource Graph (ARG), a service that enables querying Defender for Cloud's security posture data across multiple subscriptions at scale. ARG uses KQL to provide deep insights by cross-referencing ASC data with other resource properties.

## How to Use Asset Inventory

1. From Defender for Cloud's sidebar, select **Inventory**.
2. Use the **Filter by name** box to display a specific resource, or apply filters as needed.
3. Select relevant options in the filters to create the specific query you want to perform.
4. Use the **Security findings contain** filter to enter free text from the ID, security check, or CVE name of a vulnerability finding to filter the affected resources.
