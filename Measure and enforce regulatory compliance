### Regulatory Compliance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud

#### How are Regulatory Compliance Standards Represented?

**Industry standards, regulatory standards, and benchmarks** are represented in Defender for Cloudâ€™s **regulatory compliance dashboard**. Each standard is an **initiative** defined in **Azure Policy**.


Once a standard or benchmark is assigned to your selected scope, it will appear in your regulatory compliance dashboard with all associated compliance data mapped as assessments. You can also download summary reports for any assigned standards.

Microsoft tracks regulatory standards and automatically enhances its coverage over time. When Microsoft releases new content for an initiative, it will appear in your dashboard as new policies mapped to the relevant controls within the standard.
